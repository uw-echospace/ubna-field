# Union Bay Bat Monitoring

## Goals
The overarching goal of this project is to build the Union Bay Natural Area into a natural observatory for studying echolocating bats.

We are currently in the pilot phase of the project, with the following short-term goals:
- collect pilot acoustic data using low-cost ultrasonic recorders (AudioMoths)
- summarize the occurrence of bat calls throughout summer to fall
- based on bat occurrence, try trapping bats to identify species

## Protocols
Follow the steps outlined in the protocols for lab preparation, field deployment/recovery, and data uploading:
- [01_lab.md](./protocol/01_lab.md)
- [02_field.md](./protocol/02_field.md)
- [03_upload.md](./protocol/03_upload.md)

## Field records
Field records are stored under [field_records](./field_records/) and including the following entries:
- [ubna_2021.md](./field_records/ubna_2021.md)
    - 2021/06
