All dates and times were recorded in UTC and following ISO8601 format.

## Locations

**General recording sites**:
- Telephone Field

## Recorders
For each location, we had two recorders recording Daytime and Nighttime activity.

**Daytime**: 48kHz sampling rate and 0:00 to 24:00 UTC recording period. The purpose of this recorder is to record birds.

**Nighttime**: 192kHz sampling rate and 03:00 to 13:30 UTC recording period. (1 hour before Sunset and 1 hour after Sunrise, will update this recording period as sunset and sunrise times change). The purpose of this recorder is to record bats.

## Note
Recorder ON/OFF cycle is kept at 1795s/5s, so there is no subsampling scheme in place.
