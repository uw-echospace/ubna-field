# 2024 UBNA field records: after May 31st 2024

All dates and times were recorded in UTC and following ISO8601 format.

## Locations

**General recording sites**:
- Telephone Field 
- Foliage
- Central Pond
- Carp Pond
- E18 Bridge

## Recorders
During the Summer, we plan to have 1 recorder at each site with larger battery packs and SD cards to reduce labor for deployments

**Configuration**: 192kHz sampling rate and 00:00 to 24:00 UTC. 5 min ON, 5 min OFF sleep-cycle recording. This lengthened deployment from 3 days to 1 week.



Starting from Sept. 10, 2024, all Audiomoths were upgraded to 9 batteries instead of 6 batteries to help extend battery life and reduce the likelihood of the Audiomoth shutting off in the field.

Starting from Oct. 18, 2024, the records will no longer show coordinates for every deployment site due to redundance and lack of variation in the deployment site coordinates. Instead, they will only be updated when the deployment site changes. 

Starting from Oct. 25, 2024, all Audiomoths were upgraded to 256GB SD cards instead of 128GB SD cards, enabling them to last 2 weeks before having to replace batteries.
